    <h3><u>01/07/22 - 53 Books Under A Year</u></h3>
    <h4><i>How I set a goal to read 18 books in a year, and ended up reading 53!</i></h4>
    <p>As a high school student I loved reading. I often would read novels instead of paying attention in class,
    which many of my teachers allowed me to get away with regularly. When I got to college I drifted away from reading
    - eventually getting to the point where I did not read a full book for many years as an adult. Reflecting upon this,
    I made a goal that in the year 2020 I would read to completion 12 books over the course of the year.</p>
    <p>Upon completing this goal, I knew that I was capable of reading even more than an average of 1 book per
    month, so when I set my yearly goals for 2021 I decided to aim for 18 books. By changing my habits and
    working towards my goals, I was able to reach my 18 books by April 4th. I then decided to make a bold adjustment
    and aim to keep up the pace and go the whole year averaging 1 book read per week - and I did it! Here are the
    habits and tricks I used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Used a daily Habit Tracker which had "read 20+ pages" as one of my daily goals.</b> <u>Atomic Habits</u>
        is filled with many tactics to help you achieve your goals, and habit tracking has had a huge impact on my productivity
        as well as my ability to make and break habits.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Organized my bookshelf.</b> Purge any books you no longer want to read from your collection and donate
        them. I then separated the books I've read from the books I still wanted to read.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>No electronics (phone or computer) in the bedroom.</b> I found that I most often would be stuck looking
        at things on my phone till I was tired enough to fall asleep. Learning about blue light, I realized
        this habit was also making it harder for me to get to sleep. Instead I restarted my habit of reading
        before bed. Upon waking in the morning, instead of reaching for my phone and sticking it in front of my face before
        the blurriness had left my eyes, the first and only thing I could reach for was one of my
        books. This change dramatically improved my sleep and helped me often achieve my 20 page goal before
        even getting out of bed in the morning.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Read multiple books at the same time.</b> Sometimes the book I was reading no longer captivated me.
        By working my way through multiple books (usually a variety of styles, with always at least one fiction
        and non-fiction) I was always able to continue my progress.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Stopped reading a book if it really lost my interest.</b> Forcing myself through a book I was no longer
        enjoying was not a path to enjoying myself as I worked on my goal. Sometimes I would get a hundred pages in to
        a book before I decided I wanted to put it back on the shelf for another time.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>After completing a book, I collected a small stack of books for consideration from your "to-read" shelf
        and read a small portion of each, waiting for one or two to capture your interest and be "promoted" to the
        "line-up".</b> This became a mini reward for completing each book, and allowed me to always be reading
        things that I actually felt interested in.</li>
